### AI-driven Risk & ESG Compliance Analyzer (HSBC Risk Compliance Intern Project)

**Overview**: Developed an analytics platform to evaluate company compliance and credit risk using ESG and financial data. Integrated SQL for data management, Python for modeling and explainability, and Streamlit for visualization, aligned with HSBC's risk and sustainability focus.

**Key Features**:
- SQL ETL pipeline merging ESG risk ratings and financial metrics for ~100 S&P 500 companies.
- Random Forest model for risk prediction (accuracy ~0.85), with SHAP for interpretable insights.
- Interactive dashboard: Portfolio overview, company details, scenario simulations (e.g., +10% ESG impact), model summary.

**Tech Stack**: SQLite/SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP), Streamlit.

**Impact**: Demonstrates data-driven risk assessment; enables simulation of ESG improvements on credit risk. Used historical datasets for demo; extensible to real-time sources.
